- Get your reedit_id and redit_secret, required for PRAW.
- Get you telegram_token from botfather on Telegram.
- Substitute these in the lines 6, 7, 8 of the code.
- ```pip3 install python-telegram-bot praw.```
- Run main.py and boom! Your bot is ready!!

_Just like images and text, you can fetch videos too by the exact same process, and given the insane amount of information availabale on reddit, sky is the limit :beers:_
